- focus should be on the git pull-based protocol since primitives developed for that can be used in an optimized delta update protocol later on
- hash individual files in pkgs instead of concatenating * and checksumming. this allows using mmaps with Nocrypto.Hash.SHA256 so we can let the OS handle vm resources (and allows us to say which file failed the checksum)
 
- each maintainer signs packages/<pkgname>/<pkgname>.<version>.manifest containing sha256 sums of all files in packages/<pkgname>/<pkgname>.<version>/ recursively, with matching path names (starting with <pkgname>.<version> ? (alternatively include pkgname + version in manifest file somewhere else)
- maintainer public keys are stored in maintainers.pem file signed with repo maintainer key
- need a way to identify maintainers associated with pkg(version?) - pem serial, cn/email, hash?
  - should maintainers be allowed to add new pkgs to repo or should the maintainer<->pkg link be established by an offline key sig? (safer, more cumbersome - should probably)
- revoked certificates are placed in a CRL PEM signed with repo revocation key
