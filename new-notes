- A repository has the following signing keys:
  - Revocation key, for signing CRLs
    - Compromise enables attackers to revoke existing maintainer keys
  - Introduction (induction sp?) key, for signing maintainer keys
    - Compromise enables attackers to add new maintainer keys
  - Index (name?) key, for signing repository indexes.
    - Compromise enables attackers to decouple CRLs and package indexes, selectively hiding updates, changing which maintainers are associated with which projects (can't introduce new maintainers however)

- A maintainer has a "maintainer key" for authenticating package data

- `opam publish` should automatically offer to generate keys for maintainers who do not have keys, should include key-signing-request (for repo to  onsider) along with pkg data
  - keys with pending signing-requests are added to a list of unsiigned keys. users can choose to blindly trust keys on this list if functionality > security or if they have manually verified the key.
