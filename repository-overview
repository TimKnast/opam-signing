- provides some info about pkg format

Opam ships with one default repository, "https://opam.ocaml.org/", which exposes the following resources:

- /repo (file; related to git?)
    Link to repository git/current and a "browse:" link (?)

- /urls.txt (file; pulled for every update)
    Contains checksums of all files in /archives/, /compilers/, /packages/ and /repo (file) inside index.tar.gz

- /index.tar.gz (file; gzip-compressed)
    Contains /compilers/, /packages/, /version

- /archives/ (directory; stores packages)
  - /(*name of pkg*)/
    - /(*pkgname*).(*version*)/
         (* why 3 files for metadata? *)
      - opam (file; special format)
          Contains metadata and build instructions and version info
      - url (file
          Contains link to .tar.gz or git/darchs of target project
      - descr (file; short text about pkg)
      - files/ (dir; patches by maintainer)

Opam mirrors the repository in ~/.opam/repo/default/ where index.tar.gz is unpacked and installed packages are cached in archives/ (as well as in ~/.opam/archives/. The archives aren't hardlinked, so each file in the cache is stored at leasttwice.
